A "game engine" built for learning purposes mostly.

# Why
A university project and some personal fun with learning games.

# Free as in freedom
Newtonic is a completely free software project released under the terms of the GNU General Public License v3.

# Building
Currently Newtonic depends on GLFW3, OpenGL, GLEW and GLM. You have to install this dependencies before building.
For building also CMake is required.

After cloning create a folder `build`, `cd` into it and run `cmake ..` and then `make`. This will build stbi_image, then Newtonic and the playground application that exists mostly for testing the engine.
Currently building was tested only on Arch Linux and on Bionic, please open an issue if you have troubles.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome, there is no contribution guidelines yet, but hopefully there will be soon.
